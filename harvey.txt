    In
    the Kantian view, as we have seen, space is empty, pristine, and innocent,
    waiting to be divided and compartmentalized into places of distinctive
    qualities
    What
    f the very idea of space is posterior to that of place, perhaps even derived
    from it? What if local knowledge . . . precedes knowledge of space?
    place is foundational and therefore general, and space co
    ingent and particular,

    Relational spacetime starts with matter and process, and
    is therefore neither empty nor fixe
    he only interesting question—to which
    we shall return—is in what ways it might be useful to distinguish between
    place and spacetime

    The principled
    ootedness in local culture that Appiah embraces ends up folding hi
    cosmopolitanism (understood as appreciation and respect for diversity
    back into the classic liberalism of individual rights via multiculturalism,
    conveniently ignoring the recalcitrant and class-bound world of politi
    cal-economic processes of capital accumulation. Appiah thereby ends up
    eing supportive of an elitist neoliberal social order, spiced with dashe
    of multiculturalism, while ignoring the class and social inequalities that
    arise out of and continuously deepen under an individualized free market
    capitalism

    The sense of belonging and not b
    onging (and hence of identity and otherness) is closely intertwined wit
    ideas about place and territory.
    Vidal did not consider regions as given, but as a symbiotic prac
    ti-
    al achievement of long-maturing human cultural endeavors in given
    environmental settings. Distinctive regions and places are made and not
    given

    At this point the notions of region, state, and nation converge
    ith those of both territory and place, requiring us to reflect somewhat o
    he complicated histories of both these latter terms. 8

    The rise of modern state forms, an
    olitical claims to state jurisdiction and sovereignty (as exemplified in the
    reaty of Westphalia of 1648), coupled with the instantiation of a legal
    nd administrative system of private property rights, amounted to an ad
    ministrative and institutional revolution in and codification of territorial-
    izing behaviors, the primary requirement of which was the constructio
    of territorial forms that were unambiguous, fixed, and secure
    From this time onward th
    dominance of the absolute theory of the state and the relegation of relativ
    nd relational dimensions to subsidiary roles was politically assured in
    Western Europe
    it has always been ideologically
    useful, once such work has been accomplished, to “naturalize” the sens
    of nationhood by appeal to Newtonian and Cartesian conceptions of te
    itory, coupled with a temporal tale of mythological origins and a genea
    gy of descent.

    By assuming there is nothing ambiguous and insecure about the ter
    itoriality of the state, of sovereignty, and of private property, a fictitiou
    orld was created that was supposedly unmovable by, say, the comple
    patial dynamics of commodity, money, and people exchanges and capital
    accumulation in relative space-time

    processes of capital accumulation nece
    sarily internalize a distinctive form of “the territorial imperative” to cre-
    ate a landscape and territorial structures appropriate to its dynamics in a
    given place and time, only to undermine and completely displace these
    andscapes and territorial structures at later points in place and time. 12
    amaging fictions concerning state, sovereignty, and pr
    ate property need to be transformed if a saner and more secure global po-
    itical order is to be constructed
    this means
    integrating the concept of territory into the dialectics of absolute, relative
    and relational modes of approach to space and time
    the history of “territory” as a concept provides a beautiful illus
    ration of how absolute, relative, and relational conceptions of space and
    ime get dialectically integrated in particular ways through material social
    ractices (border and boundary building), representations (cartographi
    practices), and lived meanings (affective loyalties to the territorial unit of
    he nation-state

    places are not, cannot be, fixed and stable, but are subject to perpetua
    ransformations as conceptions, material practices, and lived experienc
    es change.

    The preservation or construc
    tion of a sense of place is then an active moment in the passage from
    memory to hope, from past to future. This is, one suspects, why so many
    people locate the possibility of politics in actual places. Places are sites

    For what Heidegger
    in effect proposes is an essentialist theory of place as dwelling that is a
    unique source of authentic and real meaning (hence of all real wisdom)
    reedom is here understood not as arbitrary play, but as creative
    dialogue between the inherent qualities of places and human aspirations
    and actions

    Dwelling is the capacity to achieve a spiritual unity (come to terms, for
    xample, with the genius loci) between humans and things
    If we lose the
    apacity to dwell, Heidegger argues, then we lose our roots and find our-
    elves cut off from all sources of spiritual nourishment

Page 19 (18)

    Place construction, from this perspective, must be about the recover
    d the recovery of the art of dwellin
    of roots and the recovery of the art of dwelling
    efebvre, however, transforms the Heideggerian concep
    of “dwelling” into “habiting,” in order to free it of mythical and metaphysi
    al presumptions. He likewise transforms Heidegger’s fears of the franti
    hrinking of distances into a constructive critique of what he calls the “ab
    tract space” of capitalism and the state, and introduces a class elemen
    nto the counter-politics of production of alternative space

    The quest for
    authenticity is, it turns out, itself a modern value, and it stands to be sub
    verted by the market provision of constructed authenticity, invented tradi-
    tions, and a commercialized heritage culture
    The final victory of capitalist modernity is no
    he disappearance of the nonmodern world, but its artificial preservation
    and reconstruction, as much in Heideggerian theory as in actual cultural
    practice

    o read a work in the Heideggerian mold is to
    encounter a world of no prior class distinctions, no hierarchical structures
    of social power, no complex bodies politic and social institutions, and, o
    course, no market valuations and coordinations, no military-industria
    of capital ac
    technologies, and certainly no dynamics of capital accumulation through
    uneven geographical developmen
